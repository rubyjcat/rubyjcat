Was scouting the PC, boy was it brimming with life all day. Page 1 time gaps would be as small as 3 mins ago. As expected of the busiest times. It did seem to slow down a bit after 8pm.
8:46pm NST
Pg 1 - 5 mins
Pg 7 is 5:00pm (3h 45m gap)

4:25am
Pg 1 - 33m (4:25 to 3:52)

3:12am
Pg 1 - 33m (3:12 to 2:29)
Pg 7 is 7:38pm (7h 34m gap)

Operation: Pound Catch
Because I ran out of transfers...
We're crazy enough to pound a UC and try to catch it.
I proposed a "less busy" time in terms of site activity.
The only people on around 3-4am are Malaysians and other Asian countries, but also Australians.
It's important to do it while Europe and North America are sleeping though.
Omg I'm scared if this goes wrong
Like if it does go wrong, and I end up keeping his UC, I hope I won't be reported and frozen.
I think I can trust the guy since I saw him on the PC before. I know who to stay away from (like Nacil).
kikiuma is the account with the least risk in terms of trading fodder (there aren't any)
I would still be upset if it gets frozen :K

I'm praying that Joel is successfully able to catch my UC, with myself as a backup *fingers crossed*

Update: it was a success! I ended up catching my own pet. I really needed the backup in case my internet went down (it actually did sometime after the operation).

I was thinking where to go from here with my T2. I saw a WN Coconut UFT and was tempted to offer to retrade in shuffles. I also don't know if the potential tier changes in July will affect anything. I think the Jetsam is there to stay in T2 :( it seems to be in the high end of T2s at least... I definitely know to stay away from Tyrannians xD

Ahhh
So close to getting Riou ><
Honestly though Vivianna became more tempting to me as well the longer this goes on xD seems to be a name that grows on you huh
I like it even more than Pamelia I think
But still want Riou!!! I love the names Ryota / Ryouta and Ryou. Can't have those so what's the next best option? Riou is actually a JPN RN too (obviously uncommon but still) so that's fantastic.
If I had Riou I'd probably keep him permanently on my main to zap for a long time before finalizing his colour/species (so move Kalitta to a side or use FFQ and be done xD)
I was thinking Dari Flotsam but was also open to many other possibilities
But I think he will stay on the dark side to balance the unevenness out more. Or could be one of the "yinyang" characters in a grey morality.
Something that's "dark" but also cute at the same time??? Maybe Gray?
So tori would be (perm)
Meinaesa / Miao / Riou / Sawako / Shuuta / Toua
(Miao and Riou would be super cute together :3)
(If you couldn't tell, I love my Cvvv 4Ls)
Saizana will have to stay on risu tho :/



I've worked so hard to do this trade
I felt like I just traded for a UC
This felt harder to trade for than a UC
Lmao

I did two converted to UC trades this month so that's cool.
I traded for Pamelia, very pretty name *0*
And I traded for Caeto which is just perfect for a character I had in mind!
Can't help it, I'm a sucker for RN misspells.
If trading for a converted gives you as much excitement as getting a UC, then I don't even need UCs lol. Inspiration for days~ .
Running out of pet slots and trading fodder xD

There's pets out there for everyone~



Miao

Hello I'm obsessed with names

It's funny especially after the creatable UC announcement that people are scrambling to trade their UCs for names
And I don't even care about most UCs
I'd be happy to keep just one UC, mello =3

This is my list of pets
I have a lot of pets I love dearly <3



Camren
Jilliann
Pamelia
Tahna

These lovely fem names I have, I haven't established a backstory or any idea for them
Pam has a lovely custom tho
Maybe I should work on them...
